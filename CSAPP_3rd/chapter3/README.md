Machine level representation of programs(P166-P325)
## Preface
Why should we spend our time learning machine code ?
Understand the optimization capabilities of the compiler and analyze the underlying ineffiencies in the code.(Chapter5,maximize the performance of a critical section of code; Chapter 12,program data are shared or kept private by the different threads. How to attack programs and how to guard against them.)

## 3.1 a historical perspective
29K -> 1.4G transistors, 8086, 80286, i386, i486

## 3.2 program encodings
> gcc -Og -o p p1.c p2.c

-Og instructs the compiler to apply a level of optimization that yields machine code that follows the overall structure of the original C code. (preprocessor -> assembly code -> assembler -> linker)

### 3.2.1 machine-level code
Computer systems two important forms of abstraction :

1. the format and behavior of a machine-level program is defined by the instruction set architecture(ISA, processor state, format of instructions, the effect each of these instructions will have on the state)
2. the memory addresses used by a machine-level program are virtual addresses, providing a memory model that appears to be a very large byte array.

**Parts of the processor state** are visible that normally are hidden from the C programmer:

* The program counter (commonly referred to as the PC, and called %rip in x86-
64) indicates the address in memory of the next instruction to be executed.
* The integer register file contains 16 named locations storing 64-bit values.
These registers can hold addresses (corresponding to C pointers) or integer
data. Some registers are used to keep track of critical parts of the program
state, while others are used to hold temporary data, such as the arguments
and local variables of a procedure, as well as the value to be returned by a
function.
* The condition code registers hold status information about the most recently
executed arithmetic or logical instruction. These are used to implement conditional
changes in the control or data flow, such as is requiredÂ·to implement
if and while statements.
* A set of vector registers can each hold one or more integer or floating-point
values.

The program memory contains the executable machine code for the program, some info required by the os, a run-time stack for managing procedure calls and returns, blocks of memory allocated by the user.

### 3.2.2 code examples
mstore.c

    long mult2(long, long);
    void multstore(long x, long y, long *dest) {
      long t = mult2(x, y);
      *dest = t;
    }

>gcc -Og -S mstore.c
>
>x/14b multstore
>
>gcc -Og -c mstore.c
>
>objdump -d mstore.o

>gcc -Og -o prog main.c mstore.c

Several features about machine code and its disassembled representation are worth noting:

 * x86-64 instructions can range in length from 1 to 15 bytes. The instruction encoding is designed so that commonly used instructions and those with fewer operands requixe a smaller number Rf bytes than do less common ones or ones with more operands
* The instruction format is designed in such a way that from a given starting position, there is a unique decoding of the bytes into machine instructions.For example, only the instruction pushq %rbx can start with byte value 53.
* The disassembler determines the assembly code based purely on the byte sequences in the machine-code file. It does not require access to the source or assembly-code versions of the program.
* The disassembler uses a: slightly different naming convention for the instructions than does the assembly code generated by gcc. In our example, it has omitted the suffix 'q' from many of the instructions. These suffixes are size designators and can be omitted in most cases. Conversely, the disassembler adds the suffix 'q' to the call and ret instructions. Again, these suffixes can
safely be omitted.

Some differences:
1. The linker has shifted the location of this code to a different range of addresses.
2. the linker filled in the address that the callq instruction should use in function *mult2*
3. two additional lines of code, nop nop, grow the code for the function to 16 bytes.

### 3.2.3 notes on formatting
All of the lines beginning with '.' are directives to guide the assembler and linker, we can generally ignore these.

>gcc -Og -masm=intel mstore.c

We see that the intel and ATT formats differ in the following ways:

 * The Intel code omits the size designation suffixes, We  see instruction push and mov instead of pushq
and movq.
 * The Intel code omits the '%' character in front of register names, using rbx instead of %rbx.
 * The Intel code has a different way of describing locations in 
 * 
 * 
 * -for example, QWORD PTR [rbx] rathen than (%rbx)
 * Instructions With multiple operands list them in the reverse order. This can be very confusing when, switching between the two formats.

## 3.3 data formats
1. Intel uses the term "word" to refer to a 16-bit data type.
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/intel_size_types.png "intel_size_types")

2. combining assembly code with C programs
 * write an entire function as a seperate assembly-code file and let the assembler and linker combine this with code we have written in C
 * use the inline assembly feature of gcc, where brief sections of assembly code can be incorporated into a C program using the *asm* directive.

## 3.4 accessing infomation
An x86-64 central processing unit(CPU) contains 16 general-purpose registers storing 64-bit values. These registers are used to store integer data as well as pointers. (original 8086 had eight 16-bit registers, %ax through %bp)

Two conventions arise for what happens to the remaining bytes in the register for instructions that generate less than 8 bytes : 
 * those that generate 1 or 2 byte quantities leave the remaining bytes unchanged
 * those that generate 4 byte quantities set the upper 4 bytes of the register to zero.

The stack pointer %rsp is used to indicate the end position in the run-time stack.

### 3.4.1 operand specifiers
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/operand_forms.png "operand_forms")
operand forms:

 1. immediate, constant values, written with a '$' followed by an integer using standard C notation
 2.  register, denotes the contents of a register.
 3.  memory reference, access some memory location, often called effective address.
 
### 3.4.2 data movement instructions
We group the many different instructions into instruction classes, where the instructions in a class perform the same operation but with different operand sizes.

---
**MOV class**:
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/mov_class.png "mov_class")

* source operand : immediate, stored in a register, or stored in memory;
* destination operand : register or a memory address.

The x86-64 imposes the restriction that a move instruction cannot have both operands refer to memory locations.

    movl $0x12, %eax
    movw %bp, %sp
    movb (%rdi, %rcx), %al
    movb $-1,(%rsp)
    movq %rax, -12(%rbp)

**movq** can only have immediate source operands that can be represented as 32-bit two's-complement numbers. This value is then sign extended to produce the 64-bit value for the destination. The **movabsq** instruction can have an arbitrary 64-bit immediate value as its source operand and can only have a register as a destination.

movabsq  $0x0011223344556677,%rax  %rax=$0x0011223344556677
movb $-1,%al                       %rax=$0x00112233445566FF
movl $-1,%eax                      %rax=$0x00000000FFFFFFFF

---
copy a smaller source value to a larger destination.
* source operand : register or stored in memory
* destination operand : register

**cltq** always uses register %eax as its source and %rax as the destination for the sign-extended result. Same effect : movslq %eax, %rax

###3.4.3 data movement example
1. we see that "pointers" in C are simplt address. Dereferencing a pointer involves copying that pointer into a register, and then using this register in a memory reference.
2. local variables such as x are often kept in registers rather than stored in memory locations.

### 3.4.4 pushing and poping stack data
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/stack_instruction.png "stack_instruction")
The stack grows downward such that the top element of the stack has the lowest address of all stack elements.

    pushq %rbp
    subq $8, %rsp
    movq %rbp, (%rsp)

    popq %rax
    movq (%rax)
    addq $8, %rsp

## 3.5 Arithmetic and Logical operations
Most of the operations are given as instruction classes.
The ops are divided into four groups :

 1. load effective address
 2. unary
 3. binaty
 4. shifts
 
### 3.5.1 Load Effective Address
leaq has the form of an instruction that reads from memory to a register, but it does not reference memory. Its first operand appears to be a memory reference. The instruction copies the effective address to the destination.

### 3.5.2 unary and binary operations
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/arithmetic_instructions.png "arithmetic_instructions")

This single operand of unary operations : register or a memory location. (incq ++)

Binary operations, the second operand is used as both a source and destination.(x -= y).
 
 * First operand : immediate value, register or memory location
 * Second : register or a memory location

### 3.5.3 shift operations
The different shift instructions can specify the shift amount either as an immediate value or with the single-byte register %cl.
With x86-64, a shift instruction operating on data values that are w bits long determines the shift amount from the low-order m bits of register %cl, where 2^m = w.

>%cl=0xFF, salb m=3, 7; salw m=4, 15;

### 3.5.4 discussion
### 3.5.5 special arithmetic operations
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/special_arithmetic.png  "special_arithmetic")

The assembler can tell which one is intended by counting the number of operands.

##3.6 Control
conditionals, loops, switches

1. Two ways of implementing conditional operations(conditional control and conditional move)
2. loops and switch statement

### 3.6.1 Conditional Codes
**Single-bit condition code registers**:

1. CF(Carry flag), the most recent operation generated a carry out of the most significant bit. Used to detect overflow for unsigned ops.
2. ZF(Zero flag), the most recent operation yield zero.
3. SF(sign flag), the most recent operation yield a negative value
4. DF(overflow flag), most recent operation cause a two's-complement overflow-either negative or postive.

**condition code examples**:

Suppose t = a + b, where a,b,t are integers, 
CF (unsigned) t < (unsigned) a  Unsigned overflow
ZF (t == 0)                     zero  
SF (t < 0)                      negative
OF (a<O==b<O) && (t<O !=a<O)    signed overflow


**instructions' effect to condition code**:

1. leaq does not alter any codition codes.
2. all of the instructions listed in 
3. 
4. 0 cause the condition codes to be set.
3. logical ops such as XOR, the carry and overflow flags are set to zero
4. shift ops, the carry flag is set to the last bit shifted out, overflow flag is set to zero.
5. INC and DEC set the overflow and zero flags, leaving the carry flag unchanged.

**instruction classes that set condition codes without altering any other registers**:
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/condition_code.png "condition_codes")

1. The CMP instructions behave in the same way as the SUB instructions, except that they set the condition codes without updating their destinations. Set the zero flag if the two operands are equal.
2. TEST instructions behave as AND instructions, except that they set the condition codes without updating their destinations.

### 3.6.2 accessing the condition codes
There are 3 common ways of using the condition codes:

1. we can set a single byte to 0 or 1 depending on some combination of the condition codes. (SET instructions. the suffixes for these instructions denote different conditions, not different operand sizes. "setl"-->"set less")
2. we can conditionally jump to some other part of the program
3. we can conditionally transfer data

**SET instruction **:
A SET instruction has either one of the low-order single-byte register elements, or a single-byte memory location as its destination, setting this byte to either 0 or 1.
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/set_instruction.png "set_instruction")

**Machine code does or does not distinguish between signed and unsigned values** :

1. machine code mostly uses the same instructions for the two cases
2. some circumstances require different instructions to handle signed and unsigned operations, such as using different versions of right shifts, division and multiplication instructions , and different combinations of condition codes.

### 3.6.3 Jump instructions
These jump destinations are generally indicated in assembly code by a *label*.
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/jump_instruction.png "jump_instruction")

The jmp jumps unconditionally:
1. direct jump, where the jump target is encoded as part of the instruction, by giving a label as the jump target.
2. indirect jump, where the jump target is read from a register or a memory location, using "*" followed by an operand specifier using one of the memory operand formats.(jump *%rax, jump *(%rax))

The remaining jump instructions are conditional.

### 3.6.4 Jump instruction encodings
Most commonly used encodings for jumps are **PC relative**, which encodes the difference between the address of the target instruction and the address of the instruction immediately following the jump. The value of the program counter when performing PC-relative addressing is **the address of the instruction following the jump, not that of the jump itself.**

**What do the instructions rep and repz do?**:
1. It is normally used to implement a repeating string operation.
2. rep followed by ret to avoid making the the ret instruction the destination of a conditional jump instruction.

### 3.6.5 Implementing conditional branches with conditional control

**General form assemblt implementation**:

    if (test-expr)
      then-statement
    else
      else-statement

Assembly code:

    t = test-expr;
    if (!t)
      goto false;
    then-statement
    goto done;
    false:
      else-statement
    done:
      statements
    

    t = test-expr;
    if (t)
      goto true;
    else-statement;
    goto done;
    true:
      then-statement;
    done:
      statements


### 3.6.6 Implementing Conditional branches with Conditional Moves
**Introduction**:

The conventional way to implement conditional operations is through a condition transfer of control, which can be very inefficient on modern processors. **An alter way is through a conditional transfer of data.**

Transfer of data **computes both outcomes of a conditional operation and then selects one based on whether or not the condition holds**, making sense only in restricted cases which can be implemented by a simple conditional move instruction that is better matched to the performance characteristics of mordern processors.

**Why conditional data transfers can outperform** ?
pipelining where an instruction is processed via a sequence of stages, each performing one small portion of the required operations (e.g., fetching the instruction from memory, determining the instruction type, reading from memory, performing an arithmetic operation, writing to memory, and updating the program counter).  This approach achieves high performance by overlapping the steps of the successive instructions, such as fetching one instruction while performing the arithmetic operations for a previous instruction.

To do this requires being able to d**etermine the sequence of instructions** to be executed well ahead of time in order to keep the pipeline full of instructions to be executed.  Mispredicting a jump requires the processor discard much of the work it has already done.

8 clock cycles per call when the branching pattern is easily predictable, and 17.50 clock cycles per call when the branching pattern is easily predictable.

Assume the probability of misprediction is p, without misprediction is T(OK), mispredict penalty ç½æ¬¾ç½éå¤ç½ is T(MP)
T(avg)(p) = (1-p)T(OK)+p(T(OK) + T(MP))
17.5 = 1/2 * 8 + 1/2 * (8 + T(MP)), T(MP)=19

**Conditional move instructions**:
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/condition_move.png "condition_move")

1. Source operand : register or memory, is copied to the destination only if the specified condition holds.
2. destination operand : register

The source and destination values can be 16,32,64 bits long. (Single byte conditional moves are not supported.)

v = test-expr ? then-expr ? else-exptr;

    conditional controld transfer:
    if (!test-expr)
      goto false;
      v = then-expr;
    goto done;
    false:
      v = else-expr;
    done: 
      statements;

    conditional move :
    v = then-expr;
    ve = else-expr;
    t = test-expr;
    if (!t) v = ve;

**Not all conditional expressions can be compiled using conditional moves.**:

If one of those two expressions could possibly generate an error condition or a side effect, this could lead to invalid behavior(null pointer).

**Using conditional moves also does not always improve code effiency**:

then-expr or else-expr evaluation requires a significant computation. GCC only uses conditional moves when the two expressions can be computed very easily. It uses conditional control transfers even in many cases where the cost of branch misprediction would exceed even more complex computations.

### 3.6.7 Loops
C provides several looping constructs-namely, do-while, while, and for. No corresponding instructions exist in machine code. Instead, combinations of conditional tests and jumps are used to implement the effect of loops.

#### 3.6.7.1 Do-while loops
    do
      body-statement
      while (test-expr)
    
    loop:
      body-statement
      t = test-expr;
      if (t)
        goto loop;

    long fact_do_goto(long n)
    {
      long result = 1;
    loop:
      result *= n;
      n = n - 1;
      if (n>1)
        goto loop;
      return result;
    }
    
      movl $1, %eax
    .L2:
      imulq %rdi, %rax
      subq  $1, %rdi
      cmpq $1, %rdi
      jg .L2
      rep;  ret

**Reverse engineering loops**:
Look at how registers are initialized before the loop, updated and tested within the loop, and used after the loop. Be prepared for surprising transformations.

#### 3.6.7.2 While loops
The first translation method, which we refer to as **jump to middle**, performs the initial test by performing an unconditional jump to the test at the end of the loop.

    while(test-expr)
      body-statement
    
    goto test;
    loop:
      body-statement
    test:
      t = test-expr;
      if (t)
        goto loop;

    long fact_while_jm_goto(long n)
    {
      long result = 1;
      goto test;
    loop:
      result *= n;
      n = n - 1;
    test:
      if (n > 1)
        goto loop;
      return result;
    }

The second translation method, which we refer to as **guarded do**, first transforms the code into a do-while loop by using a conditional branch to skip over the loop if the intial test fails.

    t = test-expr;
    if (!t)
      goto done;
    do
      body-statement
      while(test-expr);
    done
    
    t = test-expr;
    if (!t)
      goto done;
    loop:
      body-statement
      t = test-expr;
      if (t)
        goto loop;
    done:

    long fact_while_gd_goto(long n)
    {
      long result = 1;
      if (n<=1)
        goto done;
    loop:
      result *= n;
      n = n - 1;
      if (n != 1)
        goto loop;
    done:
      return result;
    }

      cmpq $1, %rdi
      jle .L1
      movl $1, %eax
    .L2:
      imulq %rdi, %rax
      subq $1, %rdi
      cmpq $1, %rdi
      jne .L2
      rep; ret
    .L1:
      movl $1, %eax
      ret

#### 3.6.7.3 For Loops

    for(init-expr; test-expr; update-expr)
      body-statement

The C language standard states (with one exception, continue, may cause dead loop) that the behavior of such a loop is identical to the following code using a while loop:

    init-expr;
    while(test-expr){
      body-statement;
      update-expr;
    }

    gcc -Og
    init-expr;
    goto test;
    loop:
      body-statement
      update-expr
    test:
      t = test-expr;
      if (t)
      goto loop;

    gcc -O1
    init-expr;
    t = test-expr;
    if (!t)
      goto done;
    loop:
      body-statement;
      update-expr;
      t = test-expr;
      if (t)
        goto loop
    done:

### 3.6.8 Switch statements
A switch statement provides a multiway branching capability based on the value of an integer index. Switch statements allow an efficient implementation using a data
structure called a jump table. A jump table is an array where entry i is the address of a code segment implementing the action the program should take when the switch index equals i. **The advantage of using a jump table over a long sequence of if-else statements is that the time taken to perform the switch is independent of the number of switch cases.** Jump tables are used when there are a number of cases and they span a smalle range of values.

    static void *jt[7] = {
      &&loc_A, &&loc_def, &&loc_B, 
      &&loc_C, &&loc_D, &&loc_def, &&loc_D
    }

    jmp *.L4(,%rsi, 8)  goto *jt[index]



The jump table is indicated by the following declarations:
 
      .section .rodata
      .align 8
    .L4:
      .quad .L3  case 100:loc_A
      .quad .L8  case 101:loc_def
      .quad .L5
      .quad .L6
      .quad .L7
      .quad .L8
      .quad .L7

These declarations state that within the segment of the object-code file called .rodata(read-only data), there should be 7 "quad" words, where the value of each word is given by the instruction address associated with the indicated assembly-code labels(e.g. .L3). Lable .L4 marks the start of this allocation.

## 3.7 Procedures(also called subroutine, a block of code that performs a single task, nowadays computer languages use functions not procedures)
Procedures are a key abstraction in software. Procedures come in many guises in different programming languages--functions, methods, subroutines, handlers and so on--but they all share a general set of features.

Suppose procedure P calls procedure Q, and Q then executes and returns back to P. These actions involve one or more of the following mechanisms:

1. Passing control. PC must be set to the starting address of the code for Q upon entry, and then set to the instruction in P following the call to Q upon return.
2. Passing data, P must be able to procide one or more parameters to Q, and Q must be able to return a value back to P.
3. Allocating and deallocating memory. Q may need to allocate space for local variables and then free that storage before it returns.

### 3.7.1 The Run-time stack
A key feature of the procedure-calling mechanism of C, and of most other languages,is that it can make use of the **last-in, first-out memory management discipline** provided by a **stack data structure**.

The x86-64 stack **grows toward lower addresses and the stack pointer %rsp points to the top element of the stack**. Space for data with no specified initial value can be allocated on the stack by simply decrementing the stack pointer by an appropriate amount. Similarly, space can be deallocated by incrementing the stack pointer.


The procedure's stack frame(Figure 3.25):
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/stack_frame.png "stack_frame")
Procedure P can pass up to 6 integer values(pointers and registers) on the stack, but if Q requires more arguments, these can be stored by P within its stack frame prior to the call(Argument 7-Argument n, n>7).(3.10.5)

Many procedures have six or fewer arguments, and so all of their parameters can be passed in registers. Many funcs do not even require a stack frame, which occurs when all of the local variables can be held in registers and the function does not call any other functions (sometimes referred to as a leaf procedure, in reference to the tree structure of procedure calls).

### 3.7.2 Control transfer
*call Q* instruction pushes an address A(return address) onto the stack and sets the PC to the beginning of Q. The counterpart instruction *ret* pops an address A off the stack and sets the PC to A.

![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/call_ret.png "call_ret")
A call can be either direct or indirect. The target of a direct call is given **as a label**, while the target of an indirect call is given by '*' followed by an operand specifier.

The program counter %rip and the stack pointer %rsp.
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/detailed_execute.png "detailed_execute")

### 3.7.3 data transfer
**Less than 6 arguments**:
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/register_passing_argument.png "register_passing_argument")

**more than 6 arguments**:
Assume P calls Q with n(n>6) arguments

1. the code for P allocate a stack frame with enough storage for arguments 7 through n
2. when passing parameters on the stack, all data sizes are rounded up to be multiples of eight
3. Q can access its arguments via registers and possibly from the stack
4. if Q calls some func that has more than 6 arguments, it can allocate space within its stack frame for these("Argument build area")

### 3.7.4 Local storage on the stack
At times, local data must be stored in memory:

1. there are not enough registers to hold all of the local data
2. address operator "&" is applied to a local variable
3. Some of the local variables are arrays or structures and hence must be accessed by array or structure references.

A procedure allocated space on the stack frame by decrementing the stack pointer, resulting in the portion of the stack frame labeled "Local variables" in figure 3.25.
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/procedure_call.png "procedure_call")

A more complex example:

### 3.7.5 local storage in registers
We must make sure that when one procedure (**the caller**) calls another (**the callee**), the callee does not overwrite some register value that the caller planned to use later.

By convention, **registers %rbx, %rbp, and %r12-%r15** are classified as ***callee saved*** registers. When procedure P calls procedure Q, Q must preserve the values of these registers, ensuring that they have the same values when Q returns to P as they did when Q was called. (Q can preserve a register value by either not changing it at all or by pushing the original register value on the stack,altering the register value, popping the old value from the stack before returning.) The pushing of register values has the effect of creating the portion of the stack frame labeled "Saved registers" in figure 3.25

All other registers, except for %rsp, are classified as **caller saved** registers.

## 3.8 Array allocation and access
### 3.8.1 basic principles
For data type T and integer constant N, consider a declaration of the form ***T A[N];*** Let us denote the starting location as x(A), the declaration has two effects:

1. it allocates a contiguous region of sizeof(T)*N bytes in memory
2. it introduces an identifier A that can be used as a pointer to the beginning of the array

    int E[10];//the address of E is stored in register %rdx
    movl (%rdx, %rcx, 4), %eax

### 3.8.2 Pointer arithmetic
If p is a pointer to data of type T, and the value of p is x(p), then the expression **p+i** has value **x(p) + L*i**,
where L is the size of data type T.

Suppose integer array E and integer index i are stored in %rdx and %rcx

### 3.8.3 nested arrays

    int A[5][3]
    typedef int row3_t[3];
    row3_t A[5];

Array elements are ordered in memory in row-major order, meaning all elements of row 0, which can be written A[0], followed by all elements of row 1(A[1]) and so on.

For an array declared as T D[R][C], array element D[i][j] is at memory address:

    &D[i][j] = x(D) + sizeof(T) * (C * i + j)  ------(3.1)

Example, for int A[5][3], x(A),i,i are in registers %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, &A[i][j] = %rdi + 4 * (3i + j)

    leaq (%rsi, %rsi, 2), %rax
    leaq (%rdi, %rax, 4), %rax
    movl (%rax, %rdx, 4), %eax

### 3.8.4 Fixed-size Arrays
We demonstrate some of **the optimizations for operating on multidimensional arrays of fixed size** made by gcc when the optimization level is set with the flag -01.

    #define N 16
    typedef int fix_matrix[N][N];
    int fix_prod_ele(fix_matrix A, fix_matrix B, long i, long k)
    {
    }

Clever optimations:

1. generating a pointer, Aptr, which points to the successive elements in row i of A
2. Bptr, which points to successive elements in column k of B
3. Bend, which equals the value Bptr will have when it is time to terminate the loop.


### 3.8.5 variable-size arrays
1. the register usage changes due to added parameter n
2. a multiply instruction is used to compute n*i

    int val_ele(long n, int A[n][n], long i, long j){
      return A[i][j];
    }
    
    n %rdi, A %rsi, i %rdx, j %rcx
    imulq %rdx, %rdi
    leaq (%rsi, %rdi, 4), %rax
    movl (%rax, %rcx, 4), %eax




## 3.9 Heterogeneous Data Structures å¼ææ°æ®
C provides two mechanisms for creating data types by combining objects of different types : structures(aggregate multiple objs into a single unit), unions(allow an object to be referenced using several different types).

### 3.9.1 Structures
The selection of the different fields of a structure is handled **completely at compile time**. The machine code contains no infomation about the field declarations or the names of the fields.

### 3.9.2 Unions
Unions provide a way to circumvent the type system of C, allowing a single object to be referenced according to multiple types. The overall size of a union equals the maximum size of any of its fields.

### 3.9.3 data alignment
Many computer systems place restrictions on the allowable addresses for the primitive data types, requiring that the address fpr some objects must be a multiple of some value K (typically 2, 4, or 8). 

The x86-64 hardware will work correctly regardless of the alignment of data. Intel recommends that data be aligned to improve memory system performance. Their alignment rule is based on the principle **that any primitive object of K bytes must have an address that is a multiple of K**.


.align 8

struct S2{int i; int j; char c;};

if we pack S2 into 9 bytes, but

    struct S2 array[4];//S2+9;S2+18


##3.10 Combing Control and Data in Machine-Level Programs
### 3.10.1 Understanding Pointers
Some key principles of pointers :

1. Every pointer has an associated type. Pointer types are not part of machine code, they are an abstraction provided by C to help programmers avoid addressing errors.
2. Every pointer has a value (NULL indicates that the pointer does not point anywhere)
3. Pointers are created with the '&' operator. '&' can be applied to any C expression that is categorized as an lvalue,meaning an expression that can appear on the left side of an assignment.
4. Pointers are dereferenced with the '*' operator.
5. Arrays and pointers are closely related.
6. Casting from one type of pointer to another changes its type but not its value.
7. Pointers can also point to functions. The value of a function pointer is the address of the first instruction in the machine-code representation of the function.

### 3.10.2 Life in the real world : using the gdb debugger

break *0x400540
stepi    Execute one instruction
stepi 4  Execute four instructions
nexti

disas
disas func1
disas 0x400540
disas 0x400540, 0x400550

info frame
info registers

### 3.10.3 Out-of-bounds memory references and buffer overflow
A more pernicious use of buffer overflow is to get a program to perform a function that it would otherwise be unwilling to do. The program is fed with a string that contains the byte encoding of some executable code, called the exploit code, plus some extra bytes that overwrite the return address with a pointer to the exploit code.

    void echo()
    {
    char buf[8];//allocate 24 bytes, input 24-31 bytes, corrupt return address; 32+ bytes, corrupt saved state in caller
    gets(buf);
    puts(buf);
    }

The famous Internet worm of 1998 used four different ways to gain access to many of the computers across the Internet.

### 3.10.4 Thwarting buffer overflow attacks
#### 3.10.4.1 Stack randomization
The idea of stack randomization is to **make the position of the stack vary from one run of a program to another**. This is implemented by **allocating a random amount of space between 0 and n bytes on the stack at the start of a program**. The allocation range n needs to be large enough to get sufficient variations in the stack addresses, yet small enough that it does not waste too much space in the program.

Stack randomization is one of a larger class of techniques known as address-space layout randomization, or ASLR. With ASLR, different parts of the program, including program
code, library code, stack, global variables, and heap data, are loaded into different regions of memory each time a program is run.

nop sled, if we set up a 256-byte nop sled, then the randomization over n=2^23 can be cracked by enumerating 2^15=32768 starting address. (Question, why?? 2^23 / 2^8=2^15)

#### 3.10.4.2 Stack Corruption Detection
The idea is to store a special canary value in the stack frame between any local buffer and the rest of the stack state. If canary has been altered, the program aborts with an error. gcc -fno-stack-protector

**movq %fs:40, %rax**

The instruction argument %fs:40 is an indication that the canary value is read from memory using segmented addressing, an addressing mechanism that dates back to the 80286 and is seldom found in.programs running on modern systems.

#### 3.10.4.3 Limit Executable Code Regions
More recently, AMD introduced an NX (for "no-execute") bit into the memory protection for its 64-bit processors, separating the read and execute access modes, and Intel followed suit. With this feature, the stack can be marked as being readable and writable, but not executable, and the checking of whether a page is executable is performed in hardware, with no penalty in efficiency.

### 3.10.5 Supporting Variable-Size Stack Frames
alloca, or variable-size array can allocate an arbitrary number of bytes of storage on the stack. The compiler cannot determine how much space it must allocate for the function's stack frame.

To manager a variable-size stack frame, x86-64 code uses %rbp to server as a frame pointer(sometimes referred to a base pointer).

##3.11 Floating-Point Code
1. How floating-point values are stored and accessed.
2. the instructions that operate on floating-point data
3. the conventions used for passing floating-point values as arguments to funcs and for returning them as results.
4. the conventions for how registers are preserved during function calls(i.e. caller saved, callee saved)

### 3.11.1 Floating-point movement and conversion operations
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/float_register.png "float_register")

![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/float_movement.png "float_movement")

The data are held either in memory(M(32) and M(64)), or in XMM registers (shown in the table as X). For transferring data between two XMM registers, it uses
 
 1. vmovaps for single-precision (a is for 'aligned')
 2. vmovapd for double-precision

**Conversion instructions**:
Convert from float read from (XMM register or memory) to a general-purpose register (perform truncation, rounding values toward zero)
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/two_operand_float.png "two_operand_float")

Convert from integer to floating point, first operand is read from memory or from a general-purpose register,  second operand only affects the upper bytes of the result, destination must be an XMM register.(vcvtsi2sdq %rax, %xmm1, %xmm1 reads a long integer from %rax, converts it to data type double, and stores the result in the lower bytes of XMM %xmm1,16-bytes)
![alt text](http://7xp1jz.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/csapp/3/three_operand_float.png "three_operand_float")


Converting from float --> double, Suppose the low-order 4 bytes of %xmm0 hold a single-precision value, it seems straightforward to use the instruction : vcvtss2sd %xmm0, %xmm0, %xmm0

vunpcklps %xmm0, %xmm0, %xmm0 //Replicate first vector element
vcvtps2pd %xmm0, %xmm0 //Convert two vector elements to double

* The vunpcklps is used to interleave the values in two XMM registers and store them in a third. [s3, s2, s1, s0] [d3, d2, d1, d0] then the destination register will be [s1, d1, s0, d0].
* The vcvtps2pd expands the two low-order single-precision values in the source XMM register to be the two double-precision values in the destination XMM register.

Convert from double --> float, Suppose %xmm0 holds two double [x1, x0] 

vmovddup %xmm0, %xmm0 //replicate first vector element
vcvtpd2psx %xmm0, %xmm0 //convert two vector elements to single

* vmovddup will set %xmm0 to [x0, x0]
* vcvtpd2psx convert these values to single precision, pack them into the low-order half of the register, and set the upper half to 0, [0.0, 0.0, x0, x0]


### 3.11.2 Floating-Point code in procedures
1. Up to eight floating-point arguments can be passed in XMM registers %xmm0-%xmm7.
2. A function that returns a floating-point value does so in register %xmm0.
3. All XMM registers are caller saved. The callee may overwrite any of these registers without first saving it.

## Conclusion
"movq $1, %rax" should be replced by "movl $1, %eax"

typedef VS define:
typedef obeys scoping rules just like variables, whereas define stays valid until the end of the file (or until a matching undef). something can be done with typedef that cannot be done with define

    typedef int * int_p1;
    int_p1 a,b,c;// a,b,c are all int pointers
    #define int_p2 int*
    int_p2 a,b,c //only a is a pointer
    typedef int array10[10];
    typedef int (*func_p)(int);

##Questions
1. How mant bytes is each instructions compiled to in x86 ?
