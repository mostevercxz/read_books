## Books to be read
 - The New Hacker's Dictionary
 - implement a LR parser
 - Deep Learning, https://www.amazon.cn/%E5%9B%BE%E4%B9%A6/dp/0262035618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499911243&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+learning

## What to do when encountering an unfamiliar codebase?
 - Take a lookat filesize,the biggest files contain the meat of the program
 - Single-step through the program with a debugger, starting at main dispatch loop
 - Look for data structures, particularly ones that are passed to many funcs as parameters
 - Write unit tests
 - Remove code and see what breaks
 - If on Github, try to find solutions to Github issues

## Some habits(from hn)
 - Start small, then extend
 - Change one thing at a time.
 - Add logging and error handling early.
 - Test the parts before the whole.
 - Add value.Train yourself to only do things that add value. Nobody cares if you work 80 hours a week, but it's not adding any value. Get in the habit of working on things that bring value to others.
 - More communicating, less coding.
 - Follow up. When people send you e-mails and messages. Answer as fast as you can.
 - The most valuable habit I've developed IMO is reinventing the wheel. When you face a new challenge with new concepts you're unfamiliar with, the best way to get a good grasp of the environment/tools/techniques is to rebuild it (them) from scratch.
 (the difference between reinventing the wheel for practice and learning or just because you can.)
